# AI-Based Real-Time Translation Assistant

## Project Overview

The **AI-Based Real-Time Translation Assistant** is a solution designed to help international students overcome language barriers in educational settings. By leveraging AI and automation, this tool provides real-time translation of course materials, lecture notes, and class discussions into the student's preferred language, enhancing accessibility and inclusivity.

## Problem Statement

International students often struggle with understanding course materials and participating in class discussions due to language barriers. This project aims to address this issue by developing an automation that uses AI to translate content into the student's native language in real time.

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend:**
  - HTML/CSS/JavaScript
  - React.js or Angular (Optional)
  - Bootstrap/Tailwind CSS for responsive design

- **Backend:**
  - Python
  - Flask or Django for API management
  - REST API for communication between frontend and backend

- **Machine Learning & Automation:**
  - **UiPath Studio:** Used for task automation, including reading inputs, handling user dialogs, and interacting with files.
  - **UiPath AI Center:** Manages the Multilingual Translator model, enabling real-time language translation between 200+ languages.

- **Data Handling:**
  - Excel/CSV Files for language codes and translations
  - SQLite/MySQL/PostgreSQL for scalable data storage

- **Cloud Services:**
  - AWS/GCP/Azure for deployment and hosting
  - Amazon S3/Google Cloud Storage for file storage

- **DevOps:**
  - Git/GitHub for version control
  - Jenkins/GitHub Actions for CI/CD pipeline

- **Testing:**
  - PyTest/Unittest for unit testing
  - Selenium for end-to-end testing

- **Security:**
  - OAuth/JWT for secure authentication
  - SSL/TLS for data encryption
