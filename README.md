# AI-Based Real-Time Translation Assistant

## Project Overview

The **AI-Based Real-Time Translation Assistant** is a solution designed to help international students overcome language barriers in educational settings. By leveraging AI and automation, this tool provides real-time translation of course materials, lecture notes, and class discussions into the student's preferred language, enhancing accessibility and inclusivity.

## Problem Statement

International students often struggle with understanding course materials and participating in class discussions due to language barriers. This project aims to address this issue by developing an automation that uses AI to translate content into the student's native language in real time.

## Technology Stack

  - **UiPath Studio:** Used for task automation, including reading inputs, handling user dialogs, and interacting with files.
  - **UiPath AI Center:** Manages the Multilingual Translator model, enabling real-time language translation between 200+ languages.
  - **Multilingual Translator Model:** Pre-trained model from UiPath AI Center capable of translating between 200+ languages.

## Key Features

1. **Real-Time Translation:**
   - Translate course materials, lecture notes, and discussions in real time using AI.
   
2. **Multi-Language Support:**
   - Supports over 200 languages for translation, making it accessible to a wide range of users.
   
3. **User-Friendly Interface:**
   - Intuitive design with dialog boxes to guide users through selecting languages and entering text for translation.
   
4. **Scalability:**
   - Built to handle large datasets and support multiple users simultaneously, making it suitable for educational institutions.

## How It Works

1. **Language Selection:**
   - The user selects the source language and target language using dialog prompts.
   
2. **Input Text:**
   - The user enters the text they want to translate.
   
3. **Processing:**
   - The AI model, managed through UiPath AI Center, processes the input and translates the text into the selected target language.
   
4. **Output:**
   - The translated text is returned and displayed in a message box, providing immediate feedback to the user.

## Results and Benefits
